In Python, a function is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem. 
The syntax for a function definition is: def NAME( PARAMETERS ): STATEMENTS

We can make up any names we want for the functions we create, except that we can’t use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers. There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the def.

Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a function call. We’ve already seen how to call some built-in functions like print, range and int. Function calls contain the name of the function being executed followed by a list of values, called arguments, which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition

The return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller.
The point of functions in general is to take in inputs and return something.
The return statement is used when a function is ready to return a value to its caller

The term parameter (sometimes called formal parameter) is often used to refer to the variable as found in the function definition, 
while argument (sometimes called actual parameter) refers to the actual input supplied at function call.
